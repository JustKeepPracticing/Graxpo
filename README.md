Hey Tigran, it's my first project added in Github. Can you please check it and make some comments, so that I can improve my styles. 
Note: Masonry gallery plugin isn't fixed, you told me to watch some jquery and js and then fix it. 
So I have a question for you, can I fix it via plugin settings or add some extra css styles to it ?
Check the buttons hover, they are all different, as I was practicing my sass skills, let me know which one is the best
